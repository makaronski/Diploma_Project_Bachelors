# Diploma_Project_Bachelors

For my diploma project for the bachelors degree, I've chosen to setup a website, that was supposed to work with a database. Here is the welcome page of the website(logged off):

In order to improve the functionality and make it feasible for larger quantities of users and data, I used MySQL to setup a database. It was used to store user data (after registration) in order to login to the site. The db schema is :

To connect to the DB and create sessions for users, I've used **PHP**. All the code is uploaded.

Unfortunately, because I've run it locally on Apache Web Server, I cannot upload the working website here But in order to get a sense of it, please check the [PDF](https://github.com/makaronski/Diploma_Project_Bachelors/blob/master/Diploma_Project_Bachelors.pdf). The explanation part comes after **pg.32**.
