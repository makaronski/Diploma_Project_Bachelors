# Diploma_Project_Bachelors

For my diploma project for the bachelors degree, I've chosen to setup a website, that was supposed to work with a database. The database was used to store user data in order to login to the site. The db schema is :

![DB_Schema](/Diploma_Project_Bachelors.jpg)

To connect to the DB and create sessions for users, I've used PHP.

Unfortunately, I cannot upload the working website here, but in order to get a sense of it, please check the [PDF] (https://github.com/makaronski/Diploma_Project_Bachelors/blob/master/Diploma_Project_Bachelors.pdf)
