<br></br>
Jurgen Klopp has labelled Steven Gerrard’s decision to join Liverpool’s Academy staff as “wonderful news for football" as he builds a base to enter management.

The 36-year-old called time on a stellar playing career last November and will help shape his boyhood club's next generation as a coach at the same youth system that developed his talents.

The former Reds skipper will begin his duties at Kirkby in February, initially in a floating role, and Klopp commended Gerrard’s willingness to swerve shortcuts as he works towards taking full control of a side in future.

“We had a very, very good, very long talk together,” the German detailed at Melwood on Monday.

“Probably everybody in this room knows better than I do that he’s a wonderful guy. 
<p>
“For me, it was only important to know what Steven wants, actually, and he said he wants to be a manager in the future. So, that’s cool. 
</p>
<img src="news/hd-steven-gerrard-alex-inglethorpe_yze6zgzkddpq1bo91mn8m1nix.jpg" height="392" width="700">
<br></br>“I said from my side, everything I can do to help him on this way, to make him the best manager he can be, I’m ready for this and I would like to do it.”


Klopp helped advise Gerrard on how to kickstart the next phase of his career and has no doubt the Liverpool legend will succeed in a challenging environment given his diligence and dedication.
<p>
“We spoke about different things, different options and now he’s at the Academy,” the manager said.
</p>
“That’s great for us as a club, and I think for him it’s perfect because being a manager is a job you have to learn.
<br></br>
“When a person like Steven Gerrard - the player he was, but more the person he is - is ready to make the steps, that’s wonderful news for football. 

“Combining the playing experience with all the things he’ll learn from now on, that’s a bright future and is brilliant.”			</div>
